# Basics & HTML

### What it means to be a software engineer.

- Solving problems
- Always learning
- Not always having the answers - being able to find the answer.

### Model for solving problems

- Start thinking about what the problem is
- What tools do we need to solve it
- How to use those tools - `learn keywords and syntax`
- Write code
- Execute it

### Markup language vs Programming language

### Database languages

## HTML - hyper text markup language

- Keywords - words built into language to cue things
- Syntax - grammar / how you structure code (set of rules)

## CSS - cascading style sheet

## Web Development

- Front End - what the user see (text, styling, functionality)
- Back End - structure of background information (data storage / access, logic)

## HTML Basics

- Foundational Elements - blocks (headers, paragraphs, divs)
- `<div>` - used for dividing and organizing content, grouping content for styling / logical flow
- `<span>` - used for highlighting words of phrases with styles
